## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setting Up Your Knowledge Sources

To configure which websites your agent can search, edit the `sites_data.csv` file. This CSV defines your agent's knowledge boundaries and domains:

```csv
domain,site,description
AI Agent Frameworks,github.com/openai/swarm,OpenAI Swarm documentation for lightweight multi-agent orchestration
AI Operations,docs.agentops.ai,AgentOps documentation for testing debugging and deploying AI agents and LLM apps
AI Data Frameworks,docs.llamaindex.ai,LlamaIndex documentation for building LLM-powered agents over your data
```

**CSV Structure:**
- **domain**: The subject area or topic (e.g., "AI Agents", "Web Development", "Machine Learning")
- **site**: The actual website domain to search (e.g., "docs.langchain.com", "docs.python.org")
- **description**: A clear explanation of what the site contains and when to use it

**Pro Tip:** The description is crucial - it's what the agent uses to decide whether a particular site will be helpful for answering a user's question. Be specific about what topics and types of information each site covers.

## 📊 Why Search-First Beats RAG in 2025

### Cost Reality Check

Our analysis reveals that **search-first approaches are now cost-competitive or even cheaper** than traditional RAG systems:

```python
# Fair comparison: Same model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), same token usage

# Search-First Approach (this project)
search_cost = $0.075                    # 1M tokens input + 1K output
# No additional infrastructure needed

# Traditional RAG Approach  
rag_llm_cost = $0.075                   # Same LLM costs as search-first
rag_overhead = $0.002                   # Embeddings + vector DB queries
rag_infrastructure = $0.001             # Hosting, maintenance, pipelines
total_rag_cost = $0.078                 # 4% MORE expensive than search-first!

# Ultra-affordable option
gemini_lite_cost = $0.005               # 128K context with Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite
```

### Key Findings

    class E,F,G searchPath
    class H,J,K scrapePath
    class C,F decision
```

### Core Components

1. **Domain-Restricted Agent**: LangChain agent that only searches approved knowledge sources
2. **Tavily Search Integration**: Fast, targeted search within specific documentation websites  
3. **Web Scraping Tool**: Chromium-based scraping for comprehensive page content extraction
4. **Site Restrictions**: CSV-configured domains ensure searches stay within organizational boundaries
5. **Cost Control**: Intelligent tool selection minimizes expensive operations

### Two-Tier Information Retrieval

1. **Primary: Fast Search** - Uses Tavily API to quickly search within approved documentation websites
2. **Fallback: Deep Scraping** - When search results are insufficient, automatically scrapes entire pages for comprehensive content

### Agent Decision Logic

The agent follows a **smart escalation strategy**:

1. **Analyze Query**: Determine relevant documentation sites based on technologies mentioned
2. **Search First**: Use fast Tavily search within selected domains
3. **Evaluate Results**: Assess if search provides sufficient information
4. **Scrape if Needed**: Only scrape entire pages when search results are incomplete
5. **Comprehensive Response**: Combine information from both sources for detailed answers

### Model Selection: Gemini Flash Over "Thinking" Models

This system strategically uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (non-thinking model) instead of reasoning-heavy models like o3:

| **Aspect** | **Gemini Flash (Non-Thinking)** | **o3-style (Thinking Models)** |
|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Cost** | $0.075/1M tokens | $15-60/1M tokens (200-800x more) |
| **Speed** | 2-5 seconds | 15-60 seconds |
| **Token Usage** | Minimal overhead | Heavy reasoning chains |
| **Suitability** | Perfect for tool-based workflows | Overkill for structured tasks |

**ReAct Framework Replaces Internal Reasoning:**
```
Human Query → Agent Thinks → Selects Tool → Executes → Observes → Responds
     ↑              ↑            ↑           ↑         ↑         ↑
   Input      ReAct Logic   Tool Selection  Search   Results   Answer
```

**Key Advantages:**
1. **Cost-Effective Reasoning**: ReAct provides structured thinking at 1/200th the cost
2. **Transparent Logic**: Every reasoning step is visible and debuggable  
3. **Tool-Optimized**: Designed specifically for search + scraping workflows
4. **Faster Responses**: No internal chain-of-thought overhead
5. **Easier Boundaries**: Explicit tool constraints prevent hallucination

## 📡 API Reference

The agent provides **intelligent two-tier information retrieval** through a simple REST API:

**Session Management**: The API uses secure HTTP cookies to maintain separate conversation memory for each user. When you make your first request, a unique session ID (UUID) is automatically generated and stored in a secure cookie. Each session ID creates its own agent instance with isolated memory, so your conversation history never mixes with other users - even if they're using the API simultaneously.

### Available Endpoints

- `POST /chat` - Send a question to the agent (automatically uses search + scraping as needed)
- `POST /reset` - Reset conversation memory  
- `GET /health` - Detailed health check with system status

### Chat Endpoint Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How do I create a LangChain agent with custom tools?"}'
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "response": "Based on the LangChain documentation, here's how to create a custom agent..."
}
```

## ⚡ Search Result Summarization

Enable intelligent search result summarization to reduce token usage and improve performance:

```bash
# Enable summarization in your .env file
ENABLE_SEARCH_SUMMARIZATION=true
```

### Performance Benefits

- ✅ **60-80% token reduction** while preserving key information
- ✅ **2-3x faster processing** with smaller contexts  
- ✅ **Lower costs** especially for high-volume deployments
- ✅ **Better focus** on query-relevant information
- ✅ **Automatic fallback** if summarization fails

### When to Enable

- **High-volume scenarios** (>1000 queries/day)
- **Cost-sensitive deployments** requiring maximum efficiency
- **Long documentation pages** with lots of boilerplate content
- **Latency-critical applications** where speed matters most

### Technical Details

- Uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite** for ultra-fast, cheap summarization ($0.0375/1M tokens)
- Preserves technical details, code examples, and source URLs
- Intelligent prompt focuses on query relevance
- Graceful degradation if summarization fails

This design choice makes the system **practical for production deployment** while maintaining high answer quality through structured tool usage rather than expensive internal reasoning.


## 🔒 How Site Restrictions Work

This project demonstrates **organizational AI safety** through multiple layers:

### Tavily Integration
```python
# In search_tool.py
# The agent selects which website domains to search based on the user's query
search_params = {
    "query": query,
    "include_domains": [site_info["site"] for site_info in sites_info],  # e.g., ["docs.langchain.com"]
    "max_results": max_results,
    "search_depth": search_depth
}
```

### Agent Enforcement
- Agent **must** use search tool for every question
- Questions outside configured knowledge sources trigger rejection responses
- Clear user guidance about available knowledge areas

### Configuration Details
- **Topic Domains** (CSV 'domain' column): Used for categorization and user communication
- **Website Domains** (CSV 'site' column): Used for actual search restrictions in Tavily API

### Benefits for Organizations
- ✅ **No data leakage** - searches only approved documentation websites
- ✅ **No hallucination** - responses based only on real documentation  
- ✅ **Audit trail** - all searches are logged and traceable
- ✅ **Easy updates** - modify `sites_data.csv` to change knowledge scope
- ✅ **Cost control** - limited search scope reduces API usage
